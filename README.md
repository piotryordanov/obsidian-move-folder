## Obsidian Move Folder Plugin

This plugin will allow you to move a folder anywhere in your vault.

#### Settings

There are two available settings:

1. __Delete Source Folder__: Deletes the source folder. If it is set to false, then it will copy the content to a new location
2. __ Local Only__: By setting this to true, the plugin will not go over parent directories beyond the current directory.
